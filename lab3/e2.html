        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used
        for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.
        CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, 
        alongside <span class="special">HTML and JavaScript.</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content,
         including layout, colors, and fonts.
         This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control 
         in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages 
         to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, 
         which reduces <span class="special">complexity and repetition</span> in the structural content; 
         and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages 
         that share the file and its formatting.
